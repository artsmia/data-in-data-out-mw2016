# Anything In, Anything Out

**Dynamic Data Aggregation to Web Publishing**

---

We take data, convert it to JSON, store it in Redis, index it in ElasticSearch and then publish it for the masses. Here's how...

## Setup:



# Lesson 1: Where does data come from?

### Introduction to data at Mia.

Data lives in different places and formats. For this workshop we will focus on collections data.

Graphic of data structure.

### Converting data into JSON.

JSON is a swiss army knife data representation. It's replaced
XML as the common-denominator format of data returned from APIs.

And hand building some json API data.


# Lesson 2: Fun with Redis!

### What is Redis?

[Redis](http://redis.io) is a key value store that is fast and flexible. It does simple `key: value` mappings, but beyond that it is also a "data structure store", optimized to handle different types of data quickly and effectively.

---

The basics:

* strings store a single value with the key used to retrieve it: `set name kjell` or `set day friday!`

* hashes can store multiple values behind a single key:

```
hset artist:van-gogh firstName Vincent
hset artist:van-gogh lastName "Van Gogh"
```

`hmset` can set multiple hash values in one command: `hmset artist:van-gogh birth "30 March 1853" death "29 July 1890"`

---

So now our data for Van Gogh looks like:

```
> hgetall artist:van-gogh
1) "firstName"
2) "Vincent"
3) "lastName"
4) "Van Gogh"
5) "birth"
6) "30 March 1853"
7) "death"
8) "29 July 1890"
```

Try adding an artist to your local redis database.

### Understanding Key Value stores, and how to make them work for you.

Deciding on a structure for your data in Redis is the hardest part.

For representing museum object data, the simplest solution would be to
store information about each object using the object `id` as a key. So
to look up information on `17`, I would say to redis:

```
> get object:17
"{\"id\":\"17\",\"title\":\"Sketch made on Indian Reservation, Montana\",\"medium\":\"Graphite\",â€¦}"
```

---

But as the size of the `object:` keys grows, it takes longer and longer
for redis to keep things organized. This is where the *data structure*
part of redis comes into play.

To get around the slowdown from saving thousands of `key: value` pairs,
we group artworks by their object id and store them in a series of
hashes. We call these "**buckets**". Artworks are sorted into buckets
according to their object ID. The first 1000 go into "bucket 0", the
next 1000 go into "bucket 1".

To make it easy to know which bucket an object goes in, we use the
object id divided by 1000 to assign buckets. So 278 is in bucket `0`,
1218 - `1`, 60728 - `60`, etc.

Each bucket is stored in a redis hash. Here's how to get the info on object
60728:

```
> hget object:60 60728
"{\"id\":\"60728\",\"title\":\"Celestial Horse\",\"medium\":\"Bronze with traces of polychrome\", <... lots of JSON>}"
```

# Questions?

Redis doesn't do search. It's great for storing data and accessing it
quickly, but the only way to do that is to tell redis exactly what you're
looking for.

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is a tool
for *information retrieval*. It's great at finding things.

Included in this repository is a simple php site that allows you to enter a search term and then renders the full JSON found in Redis via ElasticSearch and a styled version of the same data.
